## Description

<ul>
    <li>For this project my goal was to refactor the webpage so that the code follows accessibilty standards.</li>
    <li>I fixed broken links, consolidated many css selectors, added alt tags for images and icons, and provided comments in css.</li>
    <li>The work i have completed cleans up the code, and makes the live webpage more accessible!</li>
    <li>During this project I learn to use ARIA-label for alt image descriptions.</li>
</ul>
